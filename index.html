<h2>A funny story </h2>


 <p></p>When i was working for Ryanair, i was with a friend of mine also portuguese, at the departures hall in Charleroi getting lunch, and we heard a little girl talking in a really weird language. I look at my friend and say in portuguese 'what a weird language she is talking. How can kids learn weird languages?' 
 The kids mother heard us and replied in portuguese ' it's a weird language, isn't it? It's luxembourgish....'</p>
 <p>Lesson of the story always be careful with what you say.</p>
